## Terraform
Terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and manage your cloud infrastructure using a human-readable configuration file. It supports a wide range of cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and more.

### Difference between Terraform and Ansible
Terraform and Ansible are both used for infrastructure management, but they serve different purposes and have different use cases.
- Terraform is primarily used for provisioning and managing infrastructure, such as creating and configuring virtual machines, networks , and storage.
- Ansible is primarily used for configuration management, which means it is used to configure and manage the software running on the infrastructure, such as installing and configuring applications, services, and packages.

### Some IAC tools
- Terraform
- AWS CloudFormation
- Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
- Google Cloud Deployment Manager
- Pulumi
- AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)

### Terraform vs. CloudFormation vs. ARM vs. Deployment Manager
- Terraform is a general-purpose IaC tool that supports multiple cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. It is not specific to any cloud provider. 
- AWS CloudFormation is a service provided by AWS that allows you to create and manage infrastructure as code. It is specific to AWS. 
- Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is a service provided by Azure that allows you to create and manage infrastructure as code. It is specific to Azure.
- Google Cloud Deployment Manager is a service provided by Google Cloud that allows you to create and manage infrastructure as code. It is specific to Google Cloud.

### Advantages of using Terraform 
- **Multi-cloud support**: Terraform supports multiple cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and more.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform allows you to define and manage your infrastructure using a human-readable configuration file.
- **Version control**: Terraform supports version control, which means you can track changes to your infrastructure configuration over time.
- **Reusability**: Terraform allows you to reuse your infrastructure configuration across multiple environments, such as development, testing, and production.
- **Cost estimation**: Terraform provides cost estimation, which means you can estimate the cost of your infrastructure before provisioning it.
- **Security**: Terraform provides security features, such as encryption and access control, to ensure that your infrastructure is secure.

### Dependencies
- Implicit: Terraform has implicit dependencies on the cloud providers it supports, such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. These dependencies are managed by Terraform itself. 
- Explicit: Terraform has explicit dependencies on other tools and services, such as version control systems like Git and package managers like npm. These dependencies are managed by the user. 
- nested Explicit: Terraform has nested explicit dependencies on other tools and services, such as Ansible and Pulumi. These dependencies are managed by the user.
